# Validated Assumptions

- **Designers are the primary contributors;** engineers are the primary implementation gatekeepers.
  Discovery: Lindsey says most contributions historically come from designers; engineers often slow uptake and ask for more proof.

- **Engineering readiness depends on evidence** that a request is not a whim.
  Discovery: Lindsey notes engineers want to see thoughtfulness, multiple requests, and alignment with the current system.

- **Endorsement (by program/leader) increases priority.**
  Discovery: Lindsey states some names and programs carry more weight; political endorsement matters more than system bounds at times.

- **Open calls are less effective** than targeted calls.
  Discovery: Lindsey says open calls tend to get crickets; specific gaps perform better.

- **Slack is the best channel** for comms and recognition.
  Discovery: Lindsey confirms Slack is active and a good place to celebrate.

- **Recognition should include** team and individual contributors.
  Discovery: Lindsey prefers both team and individual shout-outs.
