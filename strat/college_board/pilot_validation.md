# Pilot Validation: Assumptions, Decisions, Questions

Use this list to validate the pilot setup. Each item includes what we learned from Lindsey and Amber in the interview.

## Assumptions to Validate

- Designers are the primary contributors; engineers are the primary implementation gatekeepers.  
  Discovery: Lindsey says most contributions historically come from designers; engineers often slow uptake and ask for more proof.
- Engineering readiness depends on evidence that a request is not a whim.  
  Discovery: Lindsey notes engineers want to see thoughtfulness, multiple requests, and alignment with the current system.
- Endorsement (by program/leader) increases priority.  
  Discovery: Lindsey states some names and programs carry more weight; political endorsement matters more than system bounds at times.
- Open calls are less effective than targeted calls.  
  Discovery: Lindsey says open calls tend to get crickets; specific gaps perform better.
- Slack is the best channel for comms and recognition.  
  Discovery: Lindsey confirms Slack is active and a good place to celebrate.
- Recognition should include team and individual contributors.  
  Discovery: Lindsey prefers both team and individual shout-outs.

## Decisions to Make

- Primary pilot audience: designers, content engineers, or mixed?  
  Discovery: Lindsey says designers are the most frequent contributors today; Emily believes content engineers need greater engagement.
- Minimum evidence required to accept a contribution (e.g., number of requests, program endorsement, proof of reuse).  
  Discovery: Lindsey suggests multiple requests and system fit are key signals.
- Pilot workflow shape: Slack-initiated → Lunch Box draft → reviews, or direct Git-first?  
  Discovery: Amber mentioned multiple intake paths; Lindsey wants simpler intake that does not create 92 required questions.
- Pilot activation model: open call vs targeted call on specific gaps.  
  Discovery: Lindsey favors targeted gaps and a named initiative.
- Initial pilot theme(s): Bluebook, K-12, or another endorsed initiative.  
  Discovery: Lindsey names Bluebook as “golden” and K-12 as a strong candidate.
- Celebration mechanism: Slack shout-out only vs shout-out + small swag (sticker/pin).  
  Discovery: Lindsey says there is little to no celebration today; even small recognition would help.
- Approval authority: design system team only vs shared with engineering leads.  
  Discovery: Engineering buy-in is required for action; they need clear fit and scope.
- Pilot success targets: cycle time and adoption goals.  
  Discovery: Lindsey is open to measuring progress if it is lightweight and practical.

## Questions to Resolve

- Which programs are high-endorsement and most likely to drive adoption in the pilot?  
  Discovery: Bluebook is widely endorsed; K-12 is another likely candidate.
- What qualifies as “fits the Design System” in a way engineers agree with?  
  Discovery: Engineers want alignment and a clear definition of scope; they push back on “why change?”
- Who is the single intake owner for pilot submissions?  
  Discovery: Lindsey expects a clear intake path; ambiguity slows action.
- What contribution types are in scope for the pilot (icons, components, patterns)?  
  Discovery: Most historical requests are small component tweaks, not full patterns.
- What is the escalation path if contributions stall in engineering review?  
  Discovery: Engineering adoption has historically been slow due to skepticism; a defined path is needed.
- How will success be measured (cycle time, adoption, satisfaction)?  
  Discovery: Amber is aiming for a rapid feedback loop and clear success criteria.
