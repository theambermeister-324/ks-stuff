Subject: Launching the Design System Contribution Workflow in Lunch Box

Hi team,

We are launching a pilot of the new Design System Contribution Workflow in Lunch Box to make it easier for teams to add patterns and components, reduce rework, and increase reuse across College Board.

Why this matters
- Faster delivery with shared, reliable UI building blocks.
- Less duplication and fewer one-off components.
- Clear ownership, reviews, and standards that scale.

Who is in the pilot
- [Team A]
- [Team B]
- [Team C]
- Design System team partners: [Names]

Pilot scope and timeline
- Scope: 3 to 5 contributions (patterns and components).
- Timeline: 6 to 8 weeks.
- Goal: move contributions from draft to ready with clear reviews and publish to the system.

Success criteria
- Contribution cycle time: draft to ready in 2 to 4 weeks.
- Adoption: at least 2 downstream uses per new contribution.
- Quality: minimal rework after review.
- Contributor satisfaction: 80% positive feedback.

How the pilot works
1) Identify a contribution (pattern or component) tied to an upcoming product need.
2) Create the draft in Lunch Box using the template.
3) Collaborate on design and engineering reviews.
4) Publish when ready and socialize adoption.

Support and expectations
- Office hours: [Day/Time]
- Dedicated system buddy: [Name]
- Slack channel: #[channel-name]
- Please aim for one contribution per team during the pilot.
