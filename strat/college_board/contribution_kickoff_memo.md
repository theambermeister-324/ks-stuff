Hi everyone,

We’re excited to share that the College Board Design System is now live in beta:
https://designsystem.collegeboard.org/

This soft launch is intentionally focused on you — the partners who have helped test early concepts, pressure-test assumptions, and shape what this system is becoming. Your feedback has already had a real impact, and this beta marks the next step in working together more openly.

What’s available in the beta
At the heart of this release is the pattern library — a growing collection of shared, reusable UI patterns grounded in real product needs across College Board. Each pattern is documented with intent, usage guidance, and accessibility considerations, with the goal of helping teams move faster while staying aligned.

Just as important, the site introduces our contribution model. The design system is not a static reference — it’s a shared product. In the beta, you’ll see:
- Clear pathways for proposing new patterns or enhancements
- Guidance on what makes a strong contribution
- Transparency into how patterns evolve from proposal → review → adoption
We see contribution as a partnership, and this tooling is designed to support that reality.

What we’re looking for now
During the beta, we’re especially eager for your perspective on:
- How usable and relevant the current patterns are for your teams
- Gaps you’re encountering in the pattern library
- How clear (or unclear) the contribution process feels in practice
This is very much a working release — some areas are still evolving, and that’s by design.

What’s to come
We will be hosting a LunchTime with LunchBox Monthly meeting on the first Tuesday of each month. Invites coming soon.
If you’d like a preview of LunchTime, please visit and join the Slack Channel: #topic-lunchtime-with-lunchbox
We will also be scheduling regular office hours for questions and support. Invites forthcoming.
Finally, we are planning on an org-wide launch towards the end of February. However, anyone can access LunchBox with an SSO login in the meantime.

Thank you again for being such thoughtful collaborators. We’re looking forward to continuing to build this system with you.
