# Decisions Needed

- **Primary pilot audience:** designers, content engineers, or mixed?
  Discovery: Lindsey says designers are the most frequent contributors today; Emily believes content engineers need greater engagement.

- **Minimum evidence required** to accept a contribution (e.g., number of requests, program endorsement, proof of reuse).
  Discovery: Lindsey suggests multiple requests and system fit are key signals.

- **Pilot workflow shape:** Slack-initiated → Lunch Box draft → reviews, or direct Git-first?
  Discovery: Amber mentioned multiple intake paths; Lindsey wants simpler intake that does not create 92 required questions.

- **Pilot activation model:** open call vs targeted call on specific gaps.
  Discovery: Lindsey favors targeted gaps and a named initiative.

- **Initial pilot theme(s):** Bluebook, K-12, or another endorsed initiative.
  Discovery: Lindsey names Bluebook as "golden" and K-12 as a strong candidate.

- **Celebration mechanism:** Slack shout-out only vs shout-out + small swag (sticker/pin).
  Discovery: Lindsey says there is little to no celebration today; even small recognition would help.

- **Approval authority:** design system team only vs shared with engineering leads.
  Discovery: Engineering buy-in is required for action; they need clear fit and scope.

- **Pilot success targets:** cycle time and adoption goals.
  Discovery: Lindsey is open to measuring progress if it is lightweight and practical.
