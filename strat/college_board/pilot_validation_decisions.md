# Decisions Made ✓

- **Minimum evidence required** to accept a contribution.
  **Decision:** Replicate acceptance of a contribution. Demonstrate package publishing for a component (button) and a pattern (filter state), then build out from there.

- **Pilot workflow shape:** Slack-initiated → Lunch Box draft → reviews, or direct Git-first?
  **Decision:** Incorporate a review/commit block to Friday WG meetings.

- **Pilot activation model:** open call vs targeted call on specific gaps.
  **Decision:** Multi-pronged approach:
  - Open call in monthly LunchTime meetings
  - Stay aware of what teams are working on and ask if they would be willing to contribute back
  - When aware of a problem that needs solving (accordions, filtering, tables), send a call out via the LB channel and ask if anyone has ideas

- **Initial pilot theme(s):** Bluebook, K-12, or another endorsed initiative.
  **Decision:** Bluebook — anything in their Storybook. Reach out to Tasha Kim and/or Josh Spiro and cc Sonny.

- **Celebration mechanism:** Slack shout-out only vs shout-out + small swag (sticker/pin).
  **Decision:** Multi-layered recognition:
  - Shout-Out (reflected glory) is the main section of LunchTime meetings
  - Quarterly swag mail to all contributors
  - Part of Pattern page: "Brought to you by (team)", link to real-time use, short use case on why they developed it

- **Approval authority:** design system team only vs shared with engineering leads.
  **Decision:** Phased approach:
  - Buildout of base repo (components, patterns, etc.) that core team will continue to build based on priorities
  - Contributions: core team will codify features, use cases, etc. and draft a simple acceptance matrix
  - Later stage: an advisory panel will expand on process as volume increases

- **Pilot success targets:** cycle time and adoption goals.
  **Decision:** 
  - Soft launch: one sprint
  - Org-wide launch: following sprint
  - Metrics: establish baseline for ingestion (GitHub if nothing else) and contributions
