# Questions to Resolve

- **Which programs** are high-endorsement and most likely to drive adoption in the pilot?
  Discovery: Bluebook is widely endorsed; K-12 is another likely candidate.

- **What qualifies as "fits the Design System"** in a way engineers agree with?
  Discovery: Engineers want alignment and a clear definition of scope; they push back on "why change?"

- **Who is the single intake owner** for pilot submissions?
  Discovery: Lindsey expects a clear intake path; ambiguity slows action.

- **What contribution types** are in scope for the pilot (icons, components, patterns)?
  Discovery: Most historical requests are small component tweaks, not full patterns.

- **What is the escalation path** if contributions stall in engineering review?
  Discovery: Engineering adoption has historically been slow due to skepticism; a defined path is needed.

- **How will success be measured** (cycle time, adoption, satisfaction)?
  Discovery: Amber is aiming for a rapid feedback loop and clear success criteria.
