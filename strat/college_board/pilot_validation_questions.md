# Questions Resolved ✓

- **Which programs** are high-endorsement and most likely to drive adoption in the pilot?
  **Answer:** Bluebook is the primary target — anything in their Storybook is in scope. Contact Tasha Kim and/or Josh Spiro (cc Sonny) to initiate.

- **What qualifies as "fits the Design System"** in a way engineers agree with?
  **Answer:** Core team will codify features, use cases, and draft a simple acceptance matrix. This provides clear, objective criteria for acceptance.

- **Who is the single intake owner** for pilot submissions?
  **Answer:** Intake will flow through Friday WG meetings with a dedicated review/commit block. LunchTime monthly meetings serve as the open call forum.

- **What contribution types** are in scope for the pilot (icons, components, patterns)?
  **Answer:** Both components and patterns are in scope. Initial demonstration will include a button (component) and filter state (pattern).

- **What is the escalation path** if contributions stall in engineering review?
  **Answer:** Friday WG meetings serve as the checkpoint. As volume increases, an advisory panel will expand on the process to handle escalations.

- **How will success be measured** (cycle time, adoption, satisfaction)?
  **Answer:** Establish baseline metrics for:
  - Ingestion tracking (GitHub if nothing else)
  - Contribution counts
  - Soft launch completes in one sprint, org-wide launch follows in the next sprint
