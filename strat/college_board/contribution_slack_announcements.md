# Slack Announcement: Pilot Kickoff (Soft Launch)
**Channel:** #topic-lunchbox-design-system

🚀 Today we are launching a pilot for the Design System Contribution Workflow in Lunch Box.

**Goal:** Make it easier to contribute, reduce rework, and increase reuse.

**Pilot focus:** Bluebook — we're starting with contributions from the Bluebook Storybook.

**Timeline:** 
- Soft launch: This sprint
- Org-wide launch: Following sprint

**What you can do now:**
- Identify one contribution your team plans to ship this quarter
- Use the Lunch Box templates to start a draft
- Bring contributions to Friday WG meeting for the review/commit block

**Initial demonstration:** We'll publish a button (component) and filter state (pattern) to showcase the full workflow.

**Docs:** See the Contributor Handbook in LunchBox
**Questions:** Reply here or join the next LunchTime meeting
