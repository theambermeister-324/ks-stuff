## Contribution types
- **Pattern:** guidance and UX structure, tied to multiple components or flows.
- **Component:** a coded UI building block.
- **Fundamental:** base elements like tokens, icons, or styles.

## Workflow at a glance
1. Start a draft in Lunch Box using the template.
2. Document purpose, intended use, and design source.
3. Request design review.
4. Present at Friday WG meeting for review/commit block.
5. Implement and request engineering review.
6. Publish when status is Ready and share adoption guidance.

## Minimum required content
- Problem statement and intended use.
- Design source (Figma link) or plan to produce it.
- Owner name and team.
- Usage guidelines and constraints.

## Quality bar by stage

**Pilot**
- Clear purpose and usage guidance.
- Design source linked.
- Owner assigned.

**Mature**
- Edge cases documented.
- Accessibility verified.
- Related patterns linked.
- Maintenance expectations noted.

## Review expectations
- Design review checks alignment with system and tokens.
- Engineering review checks API clarity, quality, and tests (when needed).
- Reviews are collaborative and aim to reduce rework.

## Roles
- **Contributor:** writes draft, responds to feedback, maintains the asset.
- **Reviewer:** provides feedback and approves readiness.

## Recognition
Your contributions will be celebrated!

- **Quarterly swag:** All contributors receive swag mail each quarter.
- **Pattern page credit:** Each pattern displays "Brought to you by (team)" with a link to real-time use and a short use case on why you developed it.

## Getting help
