# PCRI Assessment
## Leadership Briefing (1-Page)

### Purpose
Launch the Product Context Readiness Index (PCRI) as the primary lead-generation and market-validation tool that positions Knapsack as the thought leader in AI-driven product delivery.

### What the PCRI Assessment Delivers
- **PCRI Score (0-100)**: Composite readiness index across 5 pillars
- **Archetype classification**: Builder/Adopter/Optimizer/Transformer (maturity state)
- **Journey recommendation**: J1-J4 investment path aligned to org readiness
- **Industry benchmarks**: Peer comparison calibrated from 158 enterprise records
- **ROI business case**: Tied to recommended path with annual and 3-year projections
- **Evidence capture**: Optional governance/system-of-record link for enterprise credibility

### Archetype → Journey Mapping
| Archetype | PCRI Range | Typical Journey | Funnel Value |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Builder** | 0-44 | J1 Foundation | Education, diagnostic-first |
| **Adopter** | 45-54 | J2/J3 | High intent, sprint-ready |
| **Optimizer** | 55-74 | J3 Activation | Core ICP, largest gains |
| **Transformer** | 75-100 | J4 Intelligence | Expansion, MCP activation |

### Alpha vs. Public Launch
| Aspect | Alpha (Current) | Public (Post-Alpha) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Questions | 10 (PCRI Lite) | 27 (Full PCRI) |
| Time | ~10 minutes | ~15 minutes |
| Results | Director of Delivery curates | Automated |
| PDF | Manually prepared | Auto-generated |
| Culture/Delivery | Qualitative calibration | Full pillar scoring |

### Launch Recommendation
Go live with PCRI alpha as the default lead-gen and validation entry point. Full PCRI (5-pillar, 27-question) to follow based on alpha learnings.

### Conversion Hooks to Emphasize
- "PCRI score + distance to AI-ready production"
- "Archetype classification with industry peer comparison"
- "Next best investment + ROI ranges"
- "Reassess in 90 days" to support follow-up and progress tracking

### Success Metrics (First 60 Days)
| Metric | Target | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Assessment completions | 50+ | High |
| Completion rate | >80% | High |
| Evidence link capture | >25% | Medium |
| SDR meeting conversion (J2/J3/J4) | >30% | High |
| Archetype accuracy (Director validation) | >75% | High |
| ROI calculator click-through | >15% | Medium |

### Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Over-indexing on low-readiness leads | SDR routing prioritizes J2/J3/J4 + PCRI ≥ 45 |
| Market skepticism of generic assessments | Highlight 158+ enterprise benchmarks + evidence link capture |
| PCRI Lite gaps in Culture/Delivery | Director of Delivery supplements via qualitative calibration |
| Archetype misclassification | Director validates and can override during debrief |

### Decision Ask
Approve PCRI alpha launch as the primary market-validation and lead-gen asset.
