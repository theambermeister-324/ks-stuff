# PCRI Assessment
## SDR Follow-Up Playbook

### Overview
The **Product Context Readiness Index (PCRI)** is a 10-minute assessment that measures an organization's readiness to deliver governed product context for AI-enabled delivery. Results include:
- **PCRI Score** (0-100): Overall readiness index
- **Archetype** (Builder/Adopter/Optimizer/Transformer): Maturity state
- **Journey** (J1-J4): Recommended investment path
- **Industry benchmark**: Comparison to 158+ enterprise organizations

### Lead Triage (Top of Funnel)
| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **High** | J2, J3, J4 + evidence link provided + PCRI ≥ 55 |
| **Medium** | J2/J3 without evidence link, J1 with PCRI ≥ 45 |
| **Low** | J1 with PCRI < 45 and no evidence link |

4) **Journey framing**: "Your organization aligns with the {{Journey}} track toward AI-ready delivery."
5) **ROI snippet**: "Typical ROI range for this path is {{AnnualROI}} annually."
6) **Next step**: "Diagnostic or activation sprint based on your path."

### Archetype Quick Reference
| Archetype | PCRI Range | Description | Typical Engagement |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Builder** | 0-44 | Establishing foundations | 6-12 month foundation build |
| **Adopter** | 45-54 | Rapid enablement needed | 3-6 month adoption sprint |
| **Optimizer** | 55-74 | Ready for transformation | 6-9 month transformation |
| **Transformer** | 75-100 | AI workflow expansion | Ongoing innovation partnership |

### Journey-Specific Follow-Up

**J1 Foundation**
- Archetype match: Builder
- Goal: Diagnostic and education
- Talk track: "Your PCRI indicates you're building your foundation—focus on governance baseline before activation."
- CTA: Diagnostic scheduling ($50-60K)

**J2 Acceleration**
- Archetype match: Adopter/Optimizer with trigger
- Goal: Fast activation sprint
- Talk track: "Your PCRI shows you have the foundation. Trigger window matters—compress timeline."
- CTA: Sprint scoping call ($225-325K)

**J3 Activation**
- Archetype match: Adopter/Optimizer
- Goal: Services-led transformation
- Talk track: "Your PCRI indicates you're ready for activation—this unlocks the largest measurable gains."
- CTA: Diagnostic + activation roadmap ($350-450K)

**J4 Intelligence**
- Archetype match: Optimizer/Transformer
- Goal: MCP activation + expansion
- Talk track: "Your PCRI places you in the top tier—you're ready for AI-enabled execution with governed context."
- CTA: MCP activation discovery ($165-325K)

### Evidence Link Follow-Up
If evidence link provided:
- "Thanks for sharing your governance documentation. I've reviewed it and can tailor the diagnostic to your current workflow."
- Reference specific artifacts from the link in follow-up

### Disqualification Signals
- No sponsor, no budget, no timeline + PCRI < 30
- Focus on nurturing and reassessment in 90 days

### Nurture Track (Low PCRI / J1)
- Share: "AI execution gap" summary and PCRI whitepaper
- Suggest: Re-run PCRI in 90 days after governance work
- Track: Monitor for trigger events (org changes, AI initiatives, budget cycles)

### Key Metrics to Track
- PCRI score distribution by industry
- Archetype-to-journey conversion rate
- Evidence link capture rate (enterprise signal)
- Meeting booking rate by journey tier
- Time from assessment to first meeting
