## Gap Analysis: Missing Industry Standards

### 🔴 Critical Gaps

#### 1. **Partner Journey & Timeline Clarity**
**Current State:** Onboarding checklist exists but lacks:
- Clear timeline expectations (how long does onboarding take?)
- Application-to-first-engagement timeline
- Partner lifecycle stages beyond onboarding

**Industry Standard:** Leading programs show:
- Application → Qualification → Onboarding → First Engagement timeline
- Expected timeframes at each stage
- Partner maturity progression (New → Active → Advanced → Elite)

**Recommendation:** Add a "Partner Journey" section showing:
```
Application → Assessment (1-2 weeks) → Onboarding (4 weeks) → First Engagement (2-4 weeks) → Active Partner
```

#### 2. **Partner Success Manager Assignment**
**Current State:** Mentions PSM but:
- No clear assignment process
- No introduction to PSM role/responsibilities
- Placeholder contact info ("[Contact Info]")

**Industry Standard:** 
- Dedicated PSM assigned within 48 hours of application acceptance

- Regular check-in cadence (weekly for first 90 days)

**Recommendation:** Add:
- PSM assignment process and timeline
- PSM responsibilities and how they support partners
- Expected communication cadence

#### 3. **Partner Portal & Tools Access**

## Conclusion

The Knapsack Partner Onboarding Guide has a strong foundation with clear value proposition, comprehensive role definitions, and structured onboarding. However, it's missing several critical elements that are standard in leading partnership ecosystems:

1. **Partner journey clarity** - Partners need to see the full path from application to active partner
2. **Partner Success Manager process** - Critical for partner success but underdefined
3. **Deal registration** - Essential for partner engagement but missing
4. **Partner tiers** - Standard in all major programs
5. **Certification program** - Expected by partners for credibility

Implementing these recommendations will align the program with industry standards while maintaining Knapsack's unique assessment-driven approach.
