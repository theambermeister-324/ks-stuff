# SE Technical Qualification – Yes/No Decision Tree

Use this as a live decision aid during discovery calls.

---

## Step 1 – Code Framework

**Q1:** Does the customer primarily use a supported UI framework (React, Vue, Web Components, Angular, Twig, Handlebars)?

- **Yes →** Mark **Code Framework = GO** and continue.
- **No →** 
  - Is their framework in the MAYBE list (AEM React/WE, PHP Twing, Astro, Kotlin/SwiftUI)?
    - **Yes →** Mark **Code Framework = MAYBE** and flag for POC.
    - **No →** Mark **Code Framework = NO-GO** and escalate.

---

## Step 2 – Build / Compilation

**Q2:** Do they use Webpack, Vite, ESBuild, or Rollup (or can adopt one)?

- **Yes →** **Build = GO**
- **No →**
  - Do they have a Node/JS-based build we can modify?
    - **Yes →** **Build = MAYBE** (requires review of pipeline).
    - **No →** **Build = NO-GO**

---

## Step 3 – Git Provider & Access

**Q3:** Is their Git provider reachable by Knapsack Cloud (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket) with app/token access?

- **Yes →** **Git = GO**
- **No →**
  - Can they allowlist Knapsack IPs or open VPN-based access?
    - **Yes →** **Git = MAYBE**
    - **No →** **Git = NO-GO**

---

## Step 4 – CI/CD & Package Publishing

**Q4:** Do they have CI/CD that can run Node.js and npm (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure Pipelines, etc.)?

- **Yes →** **CI/CD = GO**
- **No →**
  - Do they have Jenkins / other CI that could be extended with Node/npm?
    - **Yes →** **CI/CD = MAYBE**
    - **No →** **CI/CD = NO-GO**

**Q5:** Do they have an npm-compatible package registry (npm, GitHub Packages, Azure Artifacts, etc.)?

- **Yes →** **Packages = GO**
- **No →**
  - Can one be created / approved?
    - **Yes →** **Packages = MAYBE**
    - **No →** **Packages = NO-GO**

---

## Step 5 – Hosting & Network

**Q6:** Can they host a Node.js Deployed Workspace (or use Knapsack-provided hosting)?

- **Yes →** **Hosting = GO**
- **No →**
  - Is there a path to using Knapsack-hosted workspace or new infra?
    - **Yes →** **Hosting = MAYBE**
    - **No →** **Hosting = NO-GO**

**Q7:** Can Knapsack Cloud reach their Git repo and Deployed Workspace (directly or via IP allow-list/VPN)?

- **Yes →** **Network = GO**
- **No →**
  - Is IP allow-listing or proxy feasible?
    - **Yes →** **Network = MAYBE**
    - **No →** **Network = NO-GO**

---

## Step 6 – SSO & Identity

**Q8:** Do they use Okta or Azure AD with SAML 2.0 or OAuth/OIDC?

- **Yes →** **SSO = GO**
- **No →**
  - Does their IdP support SAML/OAuth but needs custom config?
    - **Yes →** **SSO = MAYBE**
    - **No →** **SSO = NO-GO**

---

## Step 7 – Evaluate Overall Risk

Count NO-GO answers across Steps 1–6.

- **0–1 NO-GO:** ✅ Fast path. Proceed with standard implementation.
- **2–3 NO-GO:** ⚠️ Elevated risk. Bring in Architecture / Product to plan mitigations.
- **>3 NO-GO:** ❌ Not currently viable. Recommend architectural changes or different commercial path.

Use this summary at the end of the call:
- **Overall Tech Fit:** GO / MAYBE / NO-GO
- **Top 3 Risks:** (list)
- **Recommended Next Step:** POC / Deep-dive / Escalation / Disqualify
